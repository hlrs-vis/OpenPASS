\section sim_intro Introduction

This documentation contains all information about the simulation of openPASS.

The purpose of the architecture document is to explain the organization of the code and to identify major system components and describe their static attributes and dynamic patterns of interaction. 

The development description is a guide for developers how to install the framework, which technologies are used and explain each module with important concepts. 

Doxygen is an automatically generated description of the C++ sources of openPASS. It gives an overview of all classes and functions of the framework.

In section "Tests" different types of tests (e.g. Unittests, Integrationtests) which are used in openPass inclusive specifications and guidelines of them are written down.
