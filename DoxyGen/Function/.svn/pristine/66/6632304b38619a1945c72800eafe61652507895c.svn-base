# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "openPASS - PCM Function Description"



# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO

# If the EXTRACT_PACKAGE tag is set to YES, all members with package or internal
# scope will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PACKAGE        = NO

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes (and structs) defined
# locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO,
# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = NO



# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set
# to NO, these classes will be included in the various overviews. This option
# has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = NO

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = . \
						 $(SourceDir)/openPASS/Components_PCM \


FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp \

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

#EXCLUDE                =  \



# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = ./images



# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions,
# classes and enums directly into the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SOURCES         = YES



# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that the
# files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

#HTML_EXTRA_FILES       = 


               
# The CHM_FILE tag can be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm
# file. You can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be
# written to the html output directory.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTMLHELP is set to YES.

CHM_FILE               = openPASS_PCM_Function.chm



# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate a class diagram
# (in HTML and LaTeX) for classes with base or super classes. Setting the tag to
# NO turns the diagrams off. Note that this option also works with HAVE_DOT
# disabled, but it is recommended to install and use dot, since it yields more
# powerful graphs.
# The default value is: YES.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = NO



# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = NO



# If the CLASS_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for
# each documented class showing the direct and indirect inheritance relations.
# Setting this tag to YES will force the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

CLASS_GRAPH            = NO

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a
# graph for each documented class showing the direct and indirect implementation
# dependencies (inheritance, containment, and class references variables) of the
# class with other documented classes.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = NO

# If the GROUP_GRAPHS tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for
# groups, showing the direct groups dependencies.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

GROUP_GRAPHS           = YES
