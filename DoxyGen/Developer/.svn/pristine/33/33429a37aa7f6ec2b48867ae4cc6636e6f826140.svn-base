\mainpage openPASS PCM Developer Documentation (PCM)

\section secIntroduction Introduction

The openPASS tool is intended for the simulation of interaction between traffic participants to evaluate 
active safety systems. A simulation is based on a specific situation configuration and can contain 
several simulation runs (=situations) which differ due to random parameters. \n
This documentation is focused on simulating PCM cases and the neccessary components and modules.

\section secAbbreviations  Glossary and Abbreviations

|Abbreviation | Description |
|-----|---------|
|openPASS 	| Framework for the Simulative Evaluation of Active Safety Systems in Vehicles. |
|ADAS       | Advanced Driver Assistance System |
|Agent		| An arbitrary static or dynamic object in the simulation of a traffic situation. Therefore, it might (but does not have to) be a traffic participant. | 
|Component  | A module that is part of an agent´s equipment. |
|Equipment  | A set of models determining an agent´s behavior. |
|Model		| An abstract representation of a real object which might omit details e.g. ADAS, driving dynamics, pedestrian, environmental conditions. In the openPASS framework, a model consists of one or more modules as well as channels connecting them. |
|Module     | A dynamic library that is loaded and whose interface functions are called by the framework. Modules contain models or other individual functionality necessary for the simulation. Modules are exchangeable and can be fitted to various purposes ensuring ahigh flexibility of the framework. |
|PCM		| Post Crash Matrix
|Scenario   | A set of similar traffic situations. |
|Situation  | A unique variation of a traffic scenario that is described unambiguously by its spatial (e.g. road network), temporal (time, date, duration) as well as participant (e.g. starting points and intended trajectories, behaviour of people and ADAS) set up. |
