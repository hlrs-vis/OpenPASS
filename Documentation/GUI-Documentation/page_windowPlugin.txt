  @details The Window Plugin (WP) is dedicated for managing the View of openPASS application.
  It defines the main window view which includes:
  - a left side bar,
  - a widget view that changes according to the selected button on the side bar

  This structure enables creating different views for each plugin (if required).
  The window plugin registers the plugin view with its corresponding button placed
  on the side bar. It also registers the corresponding menu bar of the plugin view.\n
  When creating a plugin with a view, it should systematically include the @link WindowInterface.h Window Interface@endlink of the @link plugin Window Plugin@endlink
  in order to use its methods for registering and deregistering the View of the plugin and create a button on the side bar of the main window application
  (see Example <a href="_create__plugin_with__view-example.html">Create_Plugin_wth_View</a>).
  
  \note The design of the widget view and the menu bar of a plugin is set in the plugin itself.
  
  \note Not necessary all plugins have views (e.g. @link componentPlugin Component Plugin@endlink).
