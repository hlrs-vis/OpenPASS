*
* \section collDesc Detailed Description
* This is the slave module of the framework and it contains the main entry point of
* the simulation process.
*
* It is started by a master module with or without arguments. Following this the slave reads
* all configuration files and sets up the program parameters and the framework
* infrastructure.
* After that the simulation starts and stores its results in a prespecified file.
*
* \section Input arguments
